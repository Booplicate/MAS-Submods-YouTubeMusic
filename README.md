A submod which allows you to listen to music from youtube in the game. Compatible with [Night Music](https://github.com/multimokia/MAS-Submods/tree/NightMusic/Night%20Music). Works only on Windows. It can work on Mac/Linux, but since I don't have these installed, I won't add support to them. If you're willing to help me with testing on those systems, let me know (can open an issue).

## Installation:
1. Download the latest release from [the releases page](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-YouTubeMusic/releases).

2. Close the game and extract the content from the zip you downloaded into your `DDLC/` folder. Exactly this folder, you should have `DDLC.exe` there.

3. Install `Paste` (optionally).

If you installed it correctly, your folders will look like this:
```
DDLC/game/
    python-packages/
        *a lot of different libs*
    Submods/
        Utilities/
            paste/
                paste.rpyc
            function_plugins.rpyc
        YouTube Music/
            temp/
            ytm_overrides.rpyc
            ytm_topics.rpyc
            ytm_utils.rpyc
```
## Dependencies:
These 2 utils are required to use YouTube Music:
- [Plugin System](https://github.com/multimokia/MAS-Submods/tree/FunctionPluginUtil) (mandatory, now shipped with releases).

- [Paste](https://github.com/Legendkiller21/MAS-Submods/tree/master/Paste) (handy since allows you to paste links instead of typing them, but not required).

## Usage:
Monika will tell you everything in the game, just install the submod and launch the game. After her intro you can find the topic in the Music category.
