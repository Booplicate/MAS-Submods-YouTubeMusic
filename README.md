A submod which allows you to listen to music from youtube in the game. Compatible with [Night Music](https://github.com/multimokia/MAS-Submods/tree/NightMusic/Night%20Music).

## Installation:
1. Download the latest release from the releases page.

2. Close the game and extract the content from the zip you downloaded into your `DDLC/` folder. Exactly this folder, you should have `DDLC.exe` there.

3. Install `Plugin system` and `Paste` (links below).

If you installed it correctly, your folders will look like this:
```
DDLC/game/
    python-packages/
        *a lot of different libs*
    Submods/
        Utilities/
            paste/
                paste.rpyc
            function_plugins.rpyc
        YouTube Music/
            temp/
            ytm_overrides.rpyc
            ytm_topics.rpyc
            ytm_utils.rpyc
```
## Dependencies:
These 2 utils you'll have to install manually:
- [Plugin System](https://github.com/multimokia/MAS-Submods/tree/FunctionPluginUtil) (mandatory).

- [Paste](https://github.com/Legendkiller21/MAS-Submods/tree/master/Paste) (handy since allows you to paste links instead of typing them, but not required).
